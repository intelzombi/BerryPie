DX11 Rendering Engine
This file is complete rendering engine framework. 
It has:
Asset Importer model files.
Camera
EffectsManager
Lighting
ModelManager
ResourceManager
SceneGraph
Shuttle 
and math library

In short I created the models in Maya,  I wrote a Maya plugin to export textures and models,  I wrote an importer to import those models.
I wrote a complete DX11 Rendering engine that displays the scene created in Maya, complete with simple shadows, and effects files.
